<title>卫报对地区不平等现象的观点：仍需解决| 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-regional-inequalities-they-still-need-fixing</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Conservatives’ levelling up programme has been a failure. But Labour should embrace the goal, if not the means&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened to the “&lt;a href="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/michael-gove-reveals-renaissance-italy-inspiration-for-levelling-up-north-3497297" title=""&gt;Medici model&lt;/a&gt;”? Two years ago, Michael Gove enthusiastically outlined his desire to embed the cultural and economic dynamism of renaissance Florence in England’s neglected post-industrial regions. Sadly for the secretary of state for levelling up, it became clear that Rishi Sunak’s Treasury had no intention of releasing the kind of sums that could truly address inequalities in a disastrously unbalanced economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has unfolded instead has been an unsatisfactory cosmetic affair, in which councils hollowed out by cuts have fought for limited Westminster largesse. This week, Mr Gove’s department unveiled the third tranche of cash from the levelling up fund – around £1bn for more than 50 projects across Britain. There is no doubt that money such as that allocated to improve the Penistone railway line between Sheffield and Huddersfield is welcome. But salutary context is provided by comparing the £12bn or so dedicated to levelling up with the close to €2tn &lt;a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/expertenschaetzung-deutsche-einheit-hat-fast-zwei-billionen-euro-gekostet-12922345.html" title=""&gt;spent&lt;/a&gt; by Germany on improving living standards in its east between 1990 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-regional-inequalities-they-still-need-fixing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>每年一到节日，商家们总是努力进行疯狂的营销活动，让人感觉就像明天就没有了似的。《卫报》对节庆营销的看法：停止挥霍如无明日。| 编者观点</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-festive-marketing-stop-spending-like-theres-no-tomorrow</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Between Black Friday and Christmas we will see adverts encouraging people to desire things that don’t reveal what they could cost the planet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in November 1998, a British newspaper alerted its readers to a strange quirk of American culture. At 5am on the day after Thanksgiving, queues were forming at US shopping malls, and the roads were busy with more would-be shoppers. It was called “Black Friday”, explained the reporter, the day when retailers could expect to see their bottom lines magically go from red to black. And what was selling this year? Fluffy robots called &lt;a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/lifestyle/best-90-toys-christmas-23029810" title=""&gt;Furby&lt;/a&gt; dolls. By 6.05am, the main toyshop inside one mall in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemusings.com/the-day-the-furbies-said-no/" title=""&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; had sold out of its entire stock of Furby dolls. The Guardian’s librarians believe that this is the first mention of Black Friday in any British national newspaper. A quarter of a century later, your Furby &lt;a href="https://collectinsure.com/2023/05/16/unlock-your-furby-collections-true-value/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20find,likely%20worth%20some%20serious%20cash!" title=""&gt;may be a relic&lt;/a&gt; but Black Friday has gone global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing changes our norms, and the eight weeks of Christmas broadcasts are the industry’s yearly jamboree. It’s forecast that this month and next, a record &lt;a href="https://adassoc.org.uk/our-work/record-9-5bn-to-be-spent-during-christmas-advertising-season/" title=""&gt;£9.5bn&lt;/a&gt; will be blown on advertising, more than the UK government &lt;a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40041/documents/195520/default/" title=""&gt;spends on prisons&lt;/a&gt; in a year. This is the philosophy of “spending like there’s no tomorrow” – literally, given the climate crisis. Once Christmas has passed, the adverts will offer up many &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/20/richest-1-account-for-more-carbon-emissions-than-poorest-66-report-says" title=""&gt;alternative ways to fry the planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-festive-marketing-stop-spending-like-theres-no-tomorrow"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>对于Covid调查的观点：将科学家和政府置于显微镜下 | 编者观点</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-inquiry-scientists-and-the-government-under-the-microscope</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding on his startling diary entries, Sir Patrick Vallance gave crucial evidence from a unique perspective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the government and scientists is under the microscope as never before. The former chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, gave evidence to the Covid inquiry on Monday, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, is due to take the witness stand next. Some of Sir Patrick’s views are in the public domain already, due to the release of sections of his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/20/how-patrick-vallance-explosive-diaries-exposed-covid-chaos-inside-no-10" title=""&gt;diaries&lt;/a&gt;. Blunt descriptions of politicians including Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock echo those of other recent witnesses, who described Mr Johnson as incapable of leading and confused by science, Mr Sunak (then chancellor) as overly focused on the economy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/20/patrick-vallance-contradicts-rishi-sunak-evidence-to-covid-enquiry" title=""&gt;at the expense of health&lt;/a&gt;, and Mr Hancock (who was health secretary) as dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/20/what-we-learned-from-patrick-vallance-at-the-covid-inquiry" title=""&gt;Shocking details&lt;/a&gt; included the fact that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which Sir Patrick chaired, did not hear anything about Mr Sunak’s “Eat out to help out” scheme until it was announced. On another occasion, Mr Hancock asked for evidence contained in official advice to be changed (the request was refused).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-inquiry-scientists-and-the-government-under-the-microscope"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>《卫报》对阿根廷新总统的观点：对民主来说是黑暗的一天 | 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-argentinas-new-president-a-dark-day-for-democracy</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The election of the far-right candidate Javier Milei reflects the seriousness of the country’s problems – and threatens to deepen them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Javier Milei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/argentina-presidential-election-far-right-libertarian-javier-milei-wins-after-rival-concedes" title=""&gt;landslide election victory&lt;/a&gt;, with 55.7% of the vote to his rival’s 44.3%, is not only terrible news for Argentina but terrifying for many. In a country celebrating 40 years of hard-won democracy, the far-right economist threatens to turn the clock back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to mock the former &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/27/the-false-prophet-v-the-pope-argentina-faces-clash-of-ideologies-in-election" title=""&gt;TV celebrity and tantric sex coach&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded a chainsaw at rallies and promised that he would take it to the state. But his election as president is no joke. Among the 53-year-old libertarian’s ideas are a referendum to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/02/abortion-rights-at-risk-in-argentina-election" title=""&gt;overturn the legalisation of abortion&lt;/a&gt;, reducing gun ownership restrictions, making the trade in organs lawful, slashing social spending and abolishing the central bank. He has called the Argentina-born Pope Francis “the representative of the evil one on Earth”, smeared the victims of the military dictatorship as “terrorists” and claimed that their death toll was far smaller than the accepted 30,000 figure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-argentinas-new-president-a-dark-day-for-democracy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>英国卫报对苏丹战争的观点：毁灭和死亡大部分都没有被注意到 | 编辑部</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-war-in-sudan-destruction-and-death-are-going-largely-unnoticed</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As civilians are forced from their homes, killed, raped and enslaved, the world is preoccupied by conflict elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan’s descent from the promise of freedom to the brink of genocide has come at dizzying speed. The revolution that led to the military ousting the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 was followed by a coup that removed civilian leaders – and then, this spring, by the outbreak of war between &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/19/burhan-hemedti-army-rsf-sudan-violence-activists" title=""&gt;the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a relentless pace, the clash between the army under Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) under &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-the-feared-ex-warlord-taking-on-sudan-army-hemedti" title=""&gt;Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo&lt;/a&gt;, known as Hemedti, has spread across the country. More than 10,000 people are estimated to have been killed so far, and 4.8 million displaced internally, with another 1.2 million fleeing to neighbouring countries. The UN humanitarian coordinator for the country, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/un-warns-violence-against-civilians-in-sudan-verging-on-pure-evil" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that the violence against civilians is “verging on pure evil”. Greed for resources and power, and longstanding rivalries and hatreds, all fuel the fire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-war-in-sudan-destruction-and-death-are-going-largely-unnoticed"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>观点 | 卫报关于新词典词汇的看法：可以澄清可怕现实的沙龙游戏 | 编者的话</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-new-dictionary-words-a-parlour-game-that-can-clarify-a-scary-reality</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AI has given us hallucination as word of the year. We should quarrel with this humanising definition while recognising that it evokes unprecedented times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Cambridge dictionary announced “hallucinate” as its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/15/hallucinate-cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year" title=""&gt;word of the year this week&lt;/a&gt;, it was not referring to its existing definition as a human condition of “seeing, hearing, feeling or smelling something that does not exist”, but to the phenomenon of AI developing the capacity to make – or fake – things up. This is itself a somewhat hallucinatory concept, as Naomi Klein has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/ai-machines-hallucinating-naomi-klein" title=""&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. “Why call the errors ‘hallucinations’ at all? Why not algorithmic junk? Or glitches?” she asked. By appropriating the language of psychology, psychedelics and mysticism, she argued, the architects of generative AI had declared themselves midwives at the birth of an animate intelligence that they wanted us to believe would be an evolutionary leap for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word of the year is a strange fixture – a parlour game crossed with a marketing opportunity that is enthusiastically played by lexicographers around the world. Anyone who remembers the Oxford dictionary’s choice for 2022 will know how outlandish the offspring can be: invited to make their own choice, 318,956 people – 93% of the overall vote – &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/goblin-mode-new-oxford-word-of-the-year" title=""&gt;opted for “goblin mode”&lt;/a&gt;. Though this term (basically, slobbing out) has been around for more than a decade, its first appearance in a British newspaper, according to the research engine Factiva, was in the Observer in February last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-new-dictionary-words-a-parlour-game-that-can-clarify-a-scary-reality"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>卫报视角：保守党的秋季声明有误，奖励富人、惩罚穷人。| 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-torys-autumn-statement-wrong-to-reward-the-rich-and-punish-the-poor</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The deepening cracks in the country’s social structure are a clear sign that voters cannot just be left to face the cold winds of the market on their own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt will appeal to voters next week, if the leaks are true, on behalf of the Tory party’s worst instincts. The chancellor’s “autumn statement for growth” is said to include &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-weighing-up-inheritance-tax-cut-autumn-statement" title=""&gt;inheritance tax cuts&lt;/a&gt; that benefit the rich, reduced welfare payments which the poor rely on, and the withdrawal of free medical care from “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/16/unemployed-benefits-in-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement" title=""&gt;coasters&lt;/a&gt;” who want to “take taxpayers for a ride”. To push the idea that the state should, in a cost of living crisis, reward the rich and punish the poor reveals an appalling disregard for social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five giants of poverty first identified in the second world war – want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness – are returning in new forms. MPs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TA_APPG/status/1725437505279787079" title=""&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that the babies of poor families are dying for want of a cot as the benefit rules don’t provide for safe sleeping provision for the homeless. Diseases caused by malnutrition and associated with destitution, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bigissue.com/news/cost-of-living-crisis-malnutrition-nhs-scurvy-rickets/" title=""&gt;scurvy and rickets&lt;/a&gt;, now appear in doctors’ surgeries. With food prices 30% higher than two years ago, the ranks of the hungry are growing. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/16/cost-of-living-crisis-businesses-poverty-winter-companies-charities-gordon-brown" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; only this week that “poverty, as distinct from neglect, parental addictions or domestic violence, is now a principal cause of children being forced into care”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-torys-autumn-statement-wrong-to-reward-the-rich-and-punish-the-poor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>英国《卫报》关于英国圣公会和同性关系的观点：爱总会找到出路 | 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-c-of-e-and-same-sex-relationships-love-finds-a-way</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A decision by the church’s governing body to trial standalone blessings for couples is a significant moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat under the radar, the Church of England has just completed one of the most significant General Synods in its recent history. After a knife-edge vote, the church’s governing body &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/church-of-england-backs-plans-for-blessings-of-same-sex-weddings" title=""&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; this week to introduce, on a trial basis, standalone blessings for same-sex relationships in England. Very soon, Christian lesbian and gay couples will be able to commit themselves to each other in a church ceremony that validates and affirms the status of their love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough, after more than a decade of bitter, acrimonious debate, very nearly didn’t happen. Although a previous synod in February &lt;a href="https://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/newswatch/church-of-england-votes-in-favour-of-blessings-for-same-sex-unions-guardian/" title=""&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; the way to same-sex blessings, conservative Anglicans appeared to have persuaded the House of Bishops to &lt;a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2023/27-october/comment/leader-comment/leader-comment-living-in-love-despite-the-bishops-arguments" title=""&gt;put back&lt;/a&gt; implementation to 2025. At that point, a two‑thirds majority across bishops, clergy and laity would have been required to begin the blessings – a threshold that would have been very difficult to achieve. It was only after a late &lt;a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2023/17-november/news/uk/archbishop-of-york-backs-experimental-services-of-blessing-for-same-sex-couples" title=""&gt;intervention&lt;/a&gt; by the bishop of Oxford, the Right Rev Steven Croft, that the synod voted to circumvent the resistance campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>卫报对工党的停火投票的看法：在重大问题上的大规模反叛| 编辑</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/16/the-guardian-view-on-labours-ceasefire-vote-a-big-revolt-on-a-big-issue</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Keir Starmer and his MPs will have to treat one another’s strongly held views with magnanimity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently 198 &lt;a href="https://members.parliament.uk/parties/commons" title=""&gt;Labour MPs&lt;/a&gt; in the House of Commons. On Wednesday, 56 of them &lt;a href="https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1666" title=""&gt;backed&lt;/a&gt; a Scottish National party amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, and directly defying the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, who wanted his MPs to abstain and back a policy of humanitarian pauses. Eight Labour frontbenchers joined the revolt – they either resigned their posts or were sacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the war itself, the Westminster vote was a footnote. It was manifestly designed by the SNP to embarrass its rival party. But take the Labour rebellion seriously all the same. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/15/commons-gaza-vote-labour-defy-starmer-ceasefire-israel" title=""&gt;big revolt&lt;/a&gt; on a big issue, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67440096" title=""&gt;the worst&lt;/a&gt; that this Labour leader has suffered. More than a quarter of Labour MPs took part, in spite of a protracted effort by Sir Keir and his aides. If Labour returns to power, divisions of this kind would be likely to affect party management on foreign policy, just as they did in the past over Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>《卫报》对糖税的看法：减少拔牙数量对公共健康来说是个好消息 | 编辑</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-sugar-tax-fewer-tooth-extractions-is-great-news-for-public-health</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence that the soft drinks levy is working should embolden policymakers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of the pandemic, vast NHS waiting lists and a stream of worrying reports about rising obesity and mental illness in young people means that good news about children’s health has become a rare treat. So a study showing that the soft drinks industry levy has brought &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/15/fewer-children-in-england-having-teeth-out-since-sugar-tax-began-study-finds#:~:text=Fewer%20children%20in%20England%20have,to%20sweets%2C%20biscuits%20and%20cereals." title=""&gt;unexpected benefits&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for the youngest children, is a surprise as well as a relief. Researchers in Cambridge and Glasgow examined records of tooth extractions in English hospitals, and found that they fell by 12% over the period during which the levy was introduced – although children aged over 10 did not experience an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing concern about obesity rates was what drove the policy, which came into force in 2018. A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/26/uk-sugar-tax-prevents-5000-cases-of-obesity-in-year-6-girls-annually" title=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year suggested that the product reformulation it led to made a difference. Some 8% fewer year 6 girls (aged 10-11) were found to be obese in 2020 than would have been the case had the levy not been introduced – there had been no change for boys. The latest finding of an improvement to young children’s dental health – with an estimated 5,638 reduction overall in the number of those having teeth pulled out – can be regarded as an additional benefit over and above the original aim of weight loss. Since poor dental health in early childhood is correlated with problems later on, this is a shift with long-term significance as well as an obvious advantage to the children who have avoided rotten teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-sugar-tax-fewer-tooth-extractions-is-great-news-for-public-health"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>卫报对Rishi Sunak的庇护政策的观点：空洞的口号不能代替良好的政府管理 | 社论</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The supreme court has sunk the prime minister’s flagship policy and he is squandering a valuable opportunity to change course&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not too late for the government to align UK immigration policy with the principles of international law. It is probably too late for Rishi Sunak to derive any political benefit from a change of direction now that the supreme court has rendered his existing scheme inoperable. He must still make that change in defiance of demands from Conservative MPs to push on faster down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda" title=""&gt;court’s ruling&lt;/a&gt; is unambiguous on the point of law that prevents implementation of the government’s proposed scheme for processing asylum claims in Rwanda. Refugees deported by that mechanism would not have sufficient guarantee against being returned to the places from which they had fled in fear of persecution, torture or death. That protection – the principle of non-refoulement – is a foundational tenet of human rights law and the refugee conventions to which the UK is bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>《卫报》对塞浦路斯机密事件的观点：揭露应成为行动的催化剂 | 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/15/the-guardian-view-on-cyprus-confidential-revelations-should-be-a-spur-to-action</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Transparency and international cooperation are key to investigating offshore transactions – and also regulating them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/series/cyprus-confidential" title=""&gt;financial transactions in Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; has shed new light on the flow of money from Russian oligarchs, and its handling by or distribution to western institutions and individuals. The operations of opaque offshore structures for the wealthy often seem like matters that are not only abstruse, but also far removed from the lives of most ordinary people. Yet as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/14/cyprus-to-clamp-down-as-investigation-reveals-oligarchs-moved-assets-after-ukraine-invasion" title=""&gt;this work shows&lt;/a&gt;, they can be directly related to those involved in immediately familiar realms: current affairs coverage in Germany, Premier League football in the UK and the ownership of Europe’s largest travel company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus Confidential centres on a cache of 3.6m files leaked by an anonymous source to &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/" title=""&gt;the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)&lt;/a&gt; and Germany’s &lt;a href="https://www.papertrailmedia.de/" title=""&gt;Paper Trail Media&lt;/a&gt;, which shared access with the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and other reporting partners. Like previous leaks of records from offshore financial centres, it has exposed the mechanics of a secretive industry that veils the dealings of the super-rich and politically connected. This time, some of Russia’s wealthiest figures are at the heart of the story. The data suggests that service providers in Cyprus helped them &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/14/cyprus-to-clamp-down-as-investigation-reveals-oligarchs-moved-assets-after-ukraine-invasion" title=""&gt;transfer hundreds of millions in assets&lt;/a&gt; as EU sanctions loomed after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February. The eight-month investigation is a powerful reminder that transparency and international cooperation are essential to exposing potential wrongdoing and holding financial institutions and governments accountable. But they should not only be the concern of journalists. The same principles should guide the actions of governments, which have too often failed to take on board the lessons of previous investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>英国租房问题：住房危机也是健康危机 | 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/14/the-guardian-view-on-renting-in-britain-the-housing-crisis-is-also-a-health-crisis</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rising rents and deteriorating conditions make it clear that regulation of landlords should be tighter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of British eyes will be on Blackpool this Saturday night, as the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing show makes its feverishly anticipated annual visit to the Grade I-listed Tower Ballroom. But the architectural legacy of Blackpool’s golden age as a seaside resort has a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/13/blackpool-tenants-damp-mould-crisis" title=""&gt;hazardous side&lt;/a&gt; as well as a sparkling one – as our Living Hell series on the private rental sector has revealed this week. Astonishingly, according to the town’s council, all 18,000 of its privately rented homes – many of them former guesthouses – have a damp and mould problem. Mounting evidence points to such conditions as a cause of worsening public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the coroner at the inquest into the death of Awaab Ishak, who died as a result of exposure to black mould in Rochdale, said the verdict should be a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/15/death-of-two-year-old-awaab-ishak-chronic-mould-in-flat-a-defining-moment-says-coroner#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20things%20went%20wrong%2C%20some%20of%20them%20contributing,the%20mould%20was%20not%20taken." title=""&gt;“defining moment”&lt;/a&gt;. But while the two-year-old was an extreme case, experts believe the problems caused by substandard accommodation go much wider, and contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/nov/12/thousands-of-babies-and-toddlers-falling-sick-from-damp-homes-in-britain-nhs-doctor-warns" title=""&gt;thousands of respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt; annually. While the situation in Blackpool is acute for both geographical and historical reasons (including wet weather and the type of housing), atrocious living conditions can be found across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/14/the-guardian-view-on-renting-in-britain-the-housing-crisis-is-also-a-health-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>关于对加泰罗尼亚分裂分子的大赦协议，卫报的观点：佩德罗·桑切斯再次冒险是正确的|社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/14/the-guardian-view-on-an-amnesty-deal-for-catalan-separatists-pedro-sanchez-is-right-to-gamble-again</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Spain’s caretaker prime minister has cut a controversial deal to stay in power. It is in the country’s interest that it succeeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent political memory, few spectacles have been as surprising as the sight of David Cameron striding back into Downing Street to become Britain’s new foreign secretary. But Mr Cameron’s Lazarus-style comeback may yet be put in the shade by the career &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/carles-puigdemont-from-self-exile-to-unlikely-kingmaker-of-spanish-politics" title=""&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt; of the exiled Catalan separatist Carles Puigdemont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Spain’s inconclusive snap election in the summer, Mr Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia party has unexpectedly found itself occupying a kingmaker role as the caretaker prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, seeks enough votes to stay in power. The price of its support is an amnesty deal which could benefit Mr Puigdemont and hundreds of other activists facing criminal charges related to his failed independence campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>英国卫报对于Rishi Sunak内阁改组的观点：保守党无法逃离自身的混乱| 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunaks-reshuffle-the-tories-cant-escape-their-own-chaos</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The prime minister’s moves reveal his failure to restore trust in government after the calamitous Truss administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle reveals the identity crisis at the heart of the Conservative party. Are the Tories the party of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/04/the-astounding-return-of-liz-truss-why-do-so-many-tories-still-love-the-failed-leader" title=""&gt;tax cuts&lt;/a&gt; or of fiscal responsibility? Are they the party of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/19/tory-fury-as-ministers-axe-key-levelling-up-pledge-on-northern-civil-service-jobs" title=""&gt;levelling up&lt;/a&gt; or the City? Do they want to improve institutions or wreck them? With the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-sacked-home-secretary" title=""&gt;sacking&lt;/a&gt; of Suella Braverman from the Home Office and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/david-cameron-returns-to-uk-government-as-foreign-secretary" title=""&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of David Cameron as foreign secretary, it would be tempting to think Mr Sunak’s shift was a victory for a more recognisable, centre-right politics. But that assessment would be premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Sunak has failed to restore trust in his party after the bedlam of the Truss government. The shakeup of his team illustrates how hard it is for the Tories to escape their own chaos.&lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/cabinet-reshuffle-latest-live-downing-street-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-sacking-b1119869.html" title=""&gt;Demoting&lt;/a&gt; his health secretary in the middle of negotiations with the doctors’ union to end industrial action spells panic. It is a desperate sign to &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/greg-hands-sacked-as-conservative-party-chairman-in-rishi-sunaks-reshuffle_uk_65523042e4b0c9f246610c60#:~:text=Greg%20Hands%20has%20been%20sacked,of%20humiliating%20by%2Delection%20defeats." title=""&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; the party chairman a year before an election. No voter thinks a housing emergency of rocketing rents and soaring evictions will be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-cabinet-reshuffle-conservatives-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-65522f8a8f080565011b4801#block-65522f8a8f080565011b4801" title=""&gt;solved&lt;/a&gt; by the 16th housing minister since 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunaks-reshuffle-the-tories-cant-escape-their-own-chaos"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>对加沙伤亡的观点：呼吁停火的呼声日益高涨，必须予以重视</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-casualties-mounting-calls-for-a-ceasefire-must-be-heeded</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hospitals cannot function. The death toll mounts. Combatants must be held accountable for crimes – but first, the killing must stop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thousands injured by relentless airstrikes need treatment; the health of many more is deteriorating sharply due to the lack of clean water, food and medicines; others have taken shelter in medical facilities in the belief that surely there, at least, they will be safe. But as the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/11/1143462" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;, nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza. Israeli forces were on Monday night &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/israeli-forces-at-gates-of-gaza-main-hospital-hundreds-trapped-israel-hamas" title=""&gt;at the gates&lt;/a&gt; of al-Shifa, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/two-major-gaza-hospitals-close-new-patients-heavy-fighting-rages" title=""&gt;Gaza’s biggest hospital&lt;/a&gt;, which the WHO had already said was “not functioning as a hospital any more”. Another major site, al-Quds, had been forced to close to new patients amid Israeli airstrikes and heavy fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 11,000 are dead in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to its health ministry. While Israel casts doubt on figures from the Hamas-run ministry, one Biden administration official &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4301551-gaza-deaths-likely-higher-than-cited-us-official/" title=""&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; the tally could be even higher than cited. More than 100 UN employees &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/un-observes-minutes-silence-101-staff-killed-gaza-2023-11-13/" title=""&gt;are among the dead&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 70% of the 2m population &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-palestinian-civilian-deaths-displaced-after-1-month/" title=""&gt;are displaced&lt;/a&gt;. One Israeli minister spoke of &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-warns-ministers-to-pipe-down-after-comments-on-new-nakba-and-nuking-gaza/" title=""&gt;“Gaza’s Nakba”&lt;/a&gt;, a reference to the expulsion and dispossession of Palestinians in 1948. But though the suffering extends far beyond the walls of these hospitals, they have come to epitomise it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-casualties-mounting-calls-for-a-ceasefire-must-be-heeded"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>《卫报》对公共部门工作的观点：托儿所短缺暗示着更深层次的危机 | 编辑部</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-public-sector-work-the-nursery-shortage-points-to-a-deeper-crisis</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;From childcare to prisons, acute staffing problems across public services call for bold solutions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember Thursday nights, and the applause for key workers on doorsteps? During the pandemic, people working in demanding, public-facing jobs were rightly and warmly acclaimed. That was then. These days, staff shortages are causing problems across public services, above all in careers demanding high levels of personal interaction, including teaching, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/16/staff-shortages-prison-deaths-coroners-inquests-suicide" title=""&gt;prisons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/23/probation-officers-fear-repeat-of-failings-in-case-as-pressures-mount" title=""&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early years is the latest sector to declare that a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/06/staff-exodus-could-hinder-expansion-of-free-childcare-in-england-providers-say" title=""&gt;lack of staff&lt;/a&gt; threatens its capacity to meet families’ needs. According to research by the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, just 17% of nursery managers believe they will be able to offer the “free hours” promised by ministers from next year. About 10,000 people in England have left jobs in nurseries or as childminders since 2019, representing a 3% fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-public-sector-work-the-nursery-shortage-points-to-a-deeper-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>卫报对农业绿色转型的观点：政治局势不容乐观 | 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-farmings-green-transition-the-politics-arent-looking-good</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This month’s Cop28 climate summit will focus on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Governments need to take note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of our era’s great and inconvenient truths is that global food production and the climate emergency are intimately linked. Drought, flood and other extreme weather events &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/21/rampant-heatwaves-threaten-food-security-of-entire-planet-scientists-warn" title=""&gt;threaten&lt;/a&gt; farming ecosystems across the world. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture play a major role in global heating. We know that the default western diet, with its heavy emphasis on meat and dairy, is harming the planet. Eating habits in wealthy countries will have to change, and livestock numbers be reduced, if climate targets are to be met and vulnerable food systems saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the month, this &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/impact-farming-climate-crisis-key-cop-topic-finally" title=""&gt;message &lt;/a&gt;will be heard front and centre in the next round of the UN climate negotiations. At Cop28 in Dubai, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will foreground the need to transform patterns of consumption and production if the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is to be met. The emphasis on the impact of food systems is welcome and overdue. For various reasons it has been badly neglected at previous summits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-farmings-green-transition-the-politics-arent-looking-good"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>英国《卫报》对以色列的政治策略的观点：不能仅仅依靠无可动摇的军事实力。| 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/10/the-guardian-view-on-israels-political-strategy-it-cannot-just-be-unassailable-military-strength</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The country’s approach to the Palestinians has been shaped by the political right for a decade. It’s not working&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel has some of the most advanced armed forces in the world, but in its war against Hamas it lacks an equally sophisticated political strategy. The humanitarian catastrophe occurring in Gaza is taking on &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-gaza-water-food-f225bf0723bb5b3ae1961ba6cdef1917" title=""&gt;frightening&lt;/a&gt; dimensions. Bread is running out. Scabies and diarrhoea rip through overcrowded shelters. Brackish water is making people sick. Even US officials now &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4301551-gaza-deaths-likely-higher-than-cited-us-official/" title=""&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt; the civilian death toll is likely to be far higher than the 10,000 reported. It is talking, not fighting, that will end the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a sustainable peace plan divides Israel and its allies. When Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Israeli forces could be in Gaza &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/netanyahu-israel-consider-tactical-pauses-gaza" title=""&gt;indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;, Washington made it clear it wanted no permanent &lt;a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/at-g7-blinken-warns-israel-against-occupying-gaza/7346437.html" title=""&gt;reoccupation&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Netanyahu backed down. But he has not ruled out shrinking Gaza’s territory to create a “&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza" title=""&gt;buffer zone&lt;/a&gt;” or forcibly displacing Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history: one minister recently &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/05/netanyahu-reprimands-israeli-minister-over-gaza-nuclear-option-comment" title=""&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>卫报看待巡回歌剧：未能完成其将音乐带给人们的使命。| 社论</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/10/the-guardian-view-on-touring-opera-thwarted-in-its-mission-to-bring-music-to-the-people</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It would be a tragedy if  funding cuts reinforced the myth that a varied and vital art form is simply a pastime for the metropolitan elite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given its national treasure status and the existential shock of finding that its very survival depended on uprooting itself, discussion of the body blow to opera caused by Arts Council England (ACE) funding cuts has focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/15/enos-music-director-resigns-over-proposed-cuts-to-music-staff" title=""&gt;fate of English National Opera&lt;/a&gt; (ENO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intention – to force ENO to move from a city that had two opera houses to one that had none – might seem fair enough, in the context of a central government command to shift resources out of the capital. But it backfired badly, by drawing all the attention to one big metropolitan player rather than to the art form it champions. Less headline-hogging cuts to two other leading players, &lt;a href="https://www.glyndebourne.com/tour/glyndebourne-is-unable-to-tour-in-2023/" title=""&gt;Glyndebourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ndebourne.com/tour/glyndebourne-is-unable-to-tour-in-2023/" title=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://www.classical-music.com/news/welsh-national-opera-open-letter-laments-arts-council-funding-cut" title=""&gt;Welsh National Opera&lt;/a&gt;, simultaneously forced them to cut back on touring, leaving parts of the country with no opera at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
